# Kinetics Simulator

This notebook allows you to simulate the kinetics of an arbitrary chemical reaction network.

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have both [anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. Anaconda will allow you to install the requisite python software libraires that are needed to run the code. Git will allow you to easily access newer versions of the code as they come out.

## Setup

Before running any cells, you will need to first create a virtual environment for this notebook. To do this, navigate to the directory containing this notebook and run the following command in your terminal:

<code>conda env create -f environment.yml</code>
