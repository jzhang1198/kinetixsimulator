# kinetixsimulator

A Python package for simulating chemical reaction kinetics and global fitting of kinetic data. 

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. A package manager (like [anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)) is highly recommended. Within your virtual environment, you will need to install `python==3.9.12`. I've experienced issues with installation if this step is not done beforehand.

## Installation

After you clone the repo to your local device, run `pip install -e .` to install the library and its dependencies.

## Usage

Refer to Jupyter Notebooks within `examples` for examples outlining usage of the library code for simulating reaction kinetics and global fitting of kinetic data.
