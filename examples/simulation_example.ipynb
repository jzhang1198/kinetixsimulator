    "## Construct a KineticModel Object and Set Initial Concentrations\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing a `KineticModel` object requires a numpy array of timepoints and a mixed-type list containing objects from the following container classes: `Reaction`, `ReversibleReaction`, and/or `MMReaction`. The `Reaction` and `ReversibleReaction` reaction classes organize data for irreversible and reversible reactions. The `MMReaction` class organizes data for enzymatic reactions that obey the single substrate Michaelis-Menten equation. A more detailed discussion on usage of this class is provded in [Technical Notes](#technical-notes). Constructing reaction objects requires a string representation of the reaction scheme as well as the names/values of rate constants. When generating reaction strings, keep the following formatting rules in mind:\n",
    "1. Separate chemical species with a `+`\n",
    "2. Separate substrates and products with a `->` or `<->`\n",
    "3. Separate stoichiometric coefficients with a `*`\n",
    "4. Separate species and characters with a space\n",
    "\n",
    "Units of concentration and time can be designated by setting `concentration_units` and `time_units`, which default to ÂµM and s.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, initial concentrations of all species are set to zero. Initial concentrations can be manually set using the `set_initial_concentrations` method provided within the `KineticModel` class. "

    "### Avoiding Un-Physical Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model contains rate constants or initial concentrations that are exceptionally large, you may observe un-physical solutions (i.e. negative concentrations for some species). This can be avoided by lowering the values of the `integrator_atol` and `integrator_rtol` optional arguments in the `KineticModel` constructor, which set the error tolerance of the numerical integration algorithm used in the `simulate` method. Decreasing the increment between timepoints may help resolve these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the MMReaction Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MMReaction` class provides a more convenient means to organize data for enzymatic reactions that obey the single substrate Michaelis-Menten equation. A `MMReaction` object can be constructed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "reaction = MMReaction(reaction_string='E + S <-> E:S -> E + P', Km_name='Km', Km_value=1, kcat_name='kcat', kcat_value=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reaction strings used to construct a `MMReaction` object must contain an equilibrium describing the substrate binding step and an irreversible reaction corresponding to the chemical step. Currently, the class only supports single substrate Michaelis-Menten mechanisms. If your enzyme follows a multi substrate Michaelis-Menten mechanism, you might consider simulating your system under conditions enabling simplification to a single substrate mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "A word of caution: during construction of the `KineticModel` object, values for microscopic rate constants (i.e. substrate association and dissociation rate constants) that are consistent with the provided steady-state constants will be selected arbitrarily. Keep this in mind when interpreting simulation results! "
